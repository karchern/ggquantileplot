Description: Quantile plots are an alternative to box plots / histograms / violinplots as in that they visualize the distribution of data points.  I often found myself wanting a more 'robust' alternative to box plots when working with zero-inflated data (often found in -omics data). For very sparse data, boxplots are useless as the median (and often times even upper quartile) is equal to 0/detection limit, so all the user can see is are the outliers, which is not helpful in judging the distribution. Quantile plots are a useful alternative since they show the cutoffs of a range of quantiles.
